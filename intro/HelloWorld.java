/** Simple warm-up class to test running in Eclipse. This version uses the default
 *  package (i.e., code in the top level of the source folder, with no subdirectories)
 *  All real-world classes would use packages to avoid name conflicts, and alternative
 *  version of this class is shown later in this intro tutorial section.
 *  <p>
 *  From <a href="http://courses.coreservlets.com/Course-Materials/">the
 *  coreservlets.com tutorials on JSF 2, PrimeFaces, Ajax, JavaScript, jQuery, GWT, Android,
 *  Spring, Hibernate, JPA, RESTful Web Services, Hadoop, Spring MVC,
 *  servlets, JSP, Java 8 lambdas and streams (for those that know Java already), 
 *  and Java 8 programming (for those new to Java)</a>.
