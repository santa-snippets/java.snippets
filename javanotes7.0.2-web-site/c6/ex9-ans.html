<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.9:</h3>
<p> A <span class="newword">polygon</span> 
is a geometric figure made up of a sequence of
connected line segments. The points where the line segments meet are called the
<span class="newword">vertices</span> of the polygon. The <span class="classname">Graphics</span>
class includes commands for drawing and filling polygons. For these commands,
the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon are stored in arrays. If
<span class="code">g</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">Graphics</span> then</p>

<ul>

<li>
<span class="codedef">g.drawPolygon(xCoords, yCoords,
pointCt)</span> will draw the outline of the polygon with vertices at the points
<span class="code">(xCoords[0],yCoords[0])</span>, <span class="code">(xCoords[1],yCoords[1])</span>, ...,
<span class="code">(xCoords[pointCt-1],yCoords[pointCt-1])</span>. The third parameter,
<span class="code">pointCt</span>, is an <span class="ptype">int</span> that specifies the number of vertices of
the polygon. Its value should be 3 or greater. The first two parameters are
arrays of type <span class="code">int[]</span>. Note that the polygon automatically includes a
line from the last point, <span class="code">(xCoords[pointCt-1],yCoords[pointCt-1])</span>,
back to the starting point <span class="code">(xCoords[0],yCoords[0])</span>.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">g.fillPolygon(xCoords, yCoords,
pointCt)</span> fills the interior of the polygon with the current drawing
color. The parameters have the same meaning as in the <span class="code">drawPolygon()</span>
method. Note that it is OK for the sides of the polygon to cross each other,
but the interior of a polygon with self-intersections might not be exactly what
you expect.</li>

</ul>

<p>Write a program that lets the user draw polygons.  As the user clicks a
sequence of points, count them and store their x- and y-coordinates in two
arrays. These points will be the vertices of the polygon. As the user is creating
the polygon, you should just connect all the points with line segments.
When the user clicks near the starting point, draw the complete polygon. Draw
it with a red interior and a black border.  Once the user has completed a
polygon, the next click will clear the data and start a new polygon from scratch.
All drawing should be done in the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of my solution after the user has drawn a fairly complex polygon:</p>

<p>This is an exercise in using arrays, but it is also an exercise in using instance
variables to record the state of the program.  The <span class="code">paintComponent()</span>
method needs enough information to correctly draw the picture.  Obviously, that includes
the coordinate arrays and the number of points that have been stored in the arrays.
But the picture is different depending on whether or not the user has completed
the polygon.  If the polygon is complete, the picture shows a polygon; if not,
the picture shows line segments connecting each point to the next.  We need to 
record that basic distinction as part of the state.  We can do that using a
boolean variable, <span class="code">complete</span>, which is true when a complete polygon should
be drawn and <span class="code">false</span> while the polygon is under construction.
So, here are the necessary instance variables:</p>


<pre>int[] xCoord, yCoord;  // Arrays to hold the coordinates for up to 500 points.
int pointCt;           // Number of points in the arrays.
boolean complete;      // Set to true when a polygon is complete.</pre>


<p>The arrays <span class="code">xCoord</span> and <span class="code">yCoord</span> are examples of partially
full arrays, although there is only one counter variable that applies to both arrays.</p>


<p>Given these instance variables, the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method can
be written.  To make the picture look nicer, I decided to use two Graphics2D
features: antialiasing and wide lines. (See <a href="../c6/s2.html#GUI1.3.5">Subsection&nbsp;6.2.5</a>).
There is also a question about what to draw when there is only one point.  It's nice
if the user can see that the point has been added to the data, but one point is not
enough to draw a line or polygon.  I decided to draw a small rectangle at the point,
just to make it visible.
</p>


<pre>protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
    super.paintComponent(g);
    if (pointCt == 0)
        return; // Nothing at all to draw
    Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D)g;
    g2.setStroke( new BasicStroke(2) );
    g2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_ANTIALIASING, 
            RenderingHints.VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON);
    if (pointCt == 1) {
            // just one point -- draw a small dot there
        g.fillRect(xCoord[0], yCoord[0], 2, 2);
    }
    else if (complete) { 
            // The polygon is complete; draw it, with a black border
        g.setColor(polygonColor);
        g.fillPolygon(xCoord, yCoord, pointCt);
        g.setColor(Color.BLACK);
        g.drawPolygon(xCoord, yCoord, pointCt);
    }
    else { 
            // The polygon is not complete, just draw a series of lines.
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; pointCt - 1; i++)
            g.drawLine( xCoord[i], yCoord[i], xCoord[i+1], yCoord[i+1]);
    }
}</pre>



<p>The rest of the program logic is in the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> routine.
In that method, state variables have to change in response to the user's actions.
It requires some care to do things in the right order.  The three things that
can happen are that the user starts a new polygon, the user completes the current
polygon, or the user just adds a point to the current polygon.  The conditions should
be tested in that order:</p>


<pre>if the current polygon is complete
    start a new polygon with the point where the user clicked
else if the user clicked near the starting point
    complete the current polygon
else
    add the point that the user clicked to the data
call repaint() to make the change visible</pre>


<p>Actually, in my solution, I decided to add another case: The polygon 
can also be completed by right-clicking, or -- to be very safe -- if the number of points
has reached 500.  Also, there is a <b>bug</b> in the algorithm as
stated, where it tests "if the user clicked near the first point". This test
doesn't make sense unless there actually is a first point, that is unless
<span class="code">pointCt</span> is greater than zero. The test should really read "if
<span class="code">pointCt</span> &gt; 0 and if the user clicked near
<span class="code">(xCoord[0],yCoord[0])</span>."</p>


<p>To complete a polygon just means setting the value of the variable <span class="code">complete</span>
to true.  When <span class="code">repaint()</span> is called, the data will be displayed as a polygon.
When a new polygon is stated, the value of the variable <span class="code">complete</span>
has to be reset to false.  Also, the first point on the polygon has to be put into
the coordinate arrays, and <span class="code">pointCt</span> must be set to&nbsp;1 to indicate that
there is only one point in the data. This much is pretty straightforward to implement.</p>


<p>The only thing in the algorithm that still needs implementing is to test
whether the user clicks "near the starting point". The starting point has
coordinates <span class="code">(xCoord[0],yCoord[0])</span> and the point where the user clicked
has coordinates <span class="code">(evt.getX(),evt.getY())</span>. In my program, I check whether
the <span class="code">x</span>-coordinates of these points are three pixels or less apart and the
<span class="code">y</span>-coordinates are also two pixels or less apart. This is done by
checking whether "<span class="code">Math.abs(xCoord[0]&nbsp;-&nbsp;evt.getX()) &lt;=&nbsp;3 &amp;&amp;
Math.abs(yCoord[0]&nbsp;-&nbsp;evt.getY()) &lt;=&nbsp;3</span>".</p>
