      provides a collaborative engineering focal point of 
      interaction among various other facilities and test sites.  
      Live data from at-sea tests are displayed and analyzed 
      concurrent with the exercise.  The best models from various 
      other facilities in the U.S. are combined at SCDL to 
      provide the highest fidelity simulations.  These simulations 
      evaluate designs by comparing simulation results to 
      requirements, analyze design concepts and requirements, 
      develop scenarios to test live systems or concepts, and 
      provide hardware-in-the-loop participation in tests. The 
      facility cluster includes an electronic war room, a test 
      participation and data collection area, and a system 
      element modeling and visualization area, along with

    <lab name="Combat Systems Evaluation Laboratory (CSEL)">
      The Combat Systems Evaluation Laboratory (CSEL) was 
      established nearly 30 years ago to help develop the Aegis 
      Combat System.  CSEL has since been used to prototype 
      new systems, develop at-sea prototypes, and transition 
      prototypes to industry.  CSEL is used to develop both 
      hardware and software combat system command and control 
      elements.  This laboratory provides the facilities to 
      explore the hardware versus software trade space in the 
      early design of a prototype system.  Extensive simulations 
      and the ability to use secure real-time communications 
      from the Fleet allow system test and evaluation in a 
      near-real environment.  The performance of at-sea prototypes 
      can be predicted and quickly evaluated with these 
      capabilities.  Combat Information Center equipment, 
      displays, and decision aids have often been the products 
      of CSEL.

    <lab name="Advanced Missile Simulation and Evaluation Laboratory (AMSEL)">
      AMSEL is a closed computing facility consisting of three 
      locations linked by ethernet.  The facility provides the 
      software and hardware resources to conduct performance 
      assessments of defensive missiles and their associated 
      weapon systems.  High fidelity six-degree-of-freedom 
      missile simulations are generated as part of the weapon 
      system performance evaluations.  The products of AMSEL 
      often are concept analyses, system requirements, and 
      pre-flight and post-flight missile test analyses.

    <lab name="Microbiological Analysis Laboratory">
      The Microbiological Analysis Laboratory supports 
      counterproliferation programs that involve biological 
      agent detection. These programs use the Microbiological 
      Analysis Laboratory?s capabilities in the growth, 
      identification, quantification and analysis of bacteria, 
      fungi and viruses. This laboratory is designed for 
      evaluating environmental background collections, but 
      it can also support a wide range of microbiological 
      investigations. Technologies used in these investigations 
      encompass biochemistry, mass spectrometry, microbiology, 
      mycology, molecular biology, electronics, materials, 
      information processing, biomedicine, and modeling and 
      simulation.

      The laboratory has extensive analysis tools and equipment 
      needed for this work. For example, it contains a chemical 
      hood; three biological safety cabinets; dual-atmosphere, 
      cell-culture, and shaker-incubators; an autoclave; 
      a refrigerator and a deep-freeze; a microbiological 
      identification unit; a fluorescence microscope; an 
      anaerobe chamber; a MALDI mass spectrometer; an 
      electrophoresis system; a sterile water supply, a

      was developed to investigate the utility and covert 
      capacity of taggants (hidden features in the currency). 
      The STI develops tags that incorporate special materials 
      whose response can be stimulated and interrogated 
      (to elicit a response) at high speeds by the inspection 
      machines used by the Federal Reserve Bank. Developments in 
      reprographic and other technologies that could threaten 
      the security of U.S. currency are also monitored at the STI.

    <lab name="Avery Advanced Technology Development Laboratory (AATDL)">
      The William H. Avery Advanced Technology Development 
      Laboratory was originally built to perform altitude 
      simulations for ramjet engine development and internal 
      and external aerodynamic studies. Over the years, the 
      diverse experiments performed there have included basic 
      research on fuel penetration and mixing, 
      shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions, component testing 
      of inlets and combustors, and freejet tests of complete 
      scramjet engines.

      These capabilities also provide the infrastructure to 
      perform research in a broad range of technologies related 
      to submarine operations, space, fleet defense, and energy 
      conversion. Examples include experiments on external 
      aerodynamics, aerothermal/aero-optical sensor testing for 
      hypersonic missiles, development of target vehicles for 
      simulated Theater Ballistic Missile (TBM) intercepts, 
      and development of an arc-fault detection system to 
      provide protection in electrical switching cabinets on 
      Navy nuclear submarines.
      
      The AATDL has facilities to conduct experimental work and 
      testing of advanced systems, from conceptual design through 
      engineering development, involving instrumentation, 
      controls, high-speed data acquisition, combustion, fluid 
      dynamics, heat transfer, energy conversion, power
