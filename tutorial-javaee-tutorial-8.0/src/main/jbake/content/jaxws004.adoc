Web Services Interoperability and JAX-WS
----------------------------------------

JAX-WS supports the Web Services Interoperability (WS-I) Basic Profile
Version 1.1. The WS-I Basic Profile is a document that clarifies the
SOAP 1.1 and WSDL 1.1 specifications to promote SOAP interoperability.
For links related to WS-I, see link:jaxws005.html#BNAZE[Further
Information about JAX-WS].

To support WS-I Basic Profile Version 1.1, the JAX-WS runtime supports
doc/literal and rpc/literal encodings for services, static ports,
dynamic proxies, and the Dynamic Invocation Interface (DII).
