27 Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java EE: Advanced Topics
-----------------------------------------------------------------


This chapter describes more advanced features of Contexts and Dependency
Injection for Java EE (CDI). Specifically, it covers additional features
CDI provides to enable loose coupling of components with strong typing,
in addition to those described in link:cdi-basic002.html#GIWHL[Overview
of CDI].
